Star-forming galaxies are extremely faint radio sources, so observations need to reach sub-microJy sensitivities to detect this population at and beyond the peak of star-formation activity ("cosmic noon''). Modern precursors to future radio arrays are now capable of reaching these sensitivities through a statistical analysis of the image confusion distribution. We let the local star-formation rate density evolve with time in a cosmological model that predicts counts of faint sources over the history of the universe––adjusting the evolution to match match our observed source counts from the MeerKAT DEEP2 image. By determining the necessary luminosity and density evolution needed to match the radio source counts as a function of time, we constrained the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density. Our results based on the dust-unbiased radio observations predict somewhat stronger star formation evolution than the previous state-of-the-art models (e.g. Madau & Dickinson 2014).
