## Dark Skies, Bright Kids

[Dark Skies, Bright Kids](https://darkskiesbrightkids.com) is a primarily graduate-student led organization out of the Astronomy Department at the University of Virginia. The program's mission is "to foster the natural curiosity of children in the surrounding community by helping them to explore the Universe in a social setting with fun, hands-on activities." As a part of this team, I have organized and led week-long summer camps in rural parts of Virginia, put on Star Parties for the community that attracted 500 people, and converted our usual hands-on activities to a virtual format during the pandemic.
