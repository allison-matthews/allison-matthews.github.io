## Dark Skies, Bright Kids

[Dark Skies, Bright Kids](https://darkskiesbrightkids.com) is a primarily graduate-student led organization out of the Astronomy Department at the University of Virginia. The program's mission is "to foster the natural curiosity of children in the surrounding community by helping them to explore the Universe in a social setting with fun, hands-on activities." As a part of this team, I have organized and led week-long summer camps in rural parts of Virginia, put on Star Parties for the community that attracted 500 people, and converted our usual hands-on activities to a virtual format during the pandemic.

### The Dark Skies, Bright Kids Assessment Team

We strive to self-reflect on our efforts and assess whether our outreach program is meeting our goals. Through the "Draw a Scientist Test" we ask the students to draw their idea of a scientists both joining the club and meeting ourselves and on the last day of the program. We found that students perceive a gender imbalance (~30% drew female scientists) that only slightly improves through participation, but that there is a significant decrease in students who draw a scientist doing a stereotypical activity after the club (e.g. working with beakers).
