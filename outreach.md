## Dark Skies, Bright Kids

Dark Skies, Bright Kids is a primarily graduate-student led organization out of the Astronomy Department at the University of Virginia. The program's mission is "to foster the natural curiosity of children in the surrounding community by helping them to explore the Universe in a social setting with fun, hands-on activities."
