## UNIX Introduction
UNIX is an operating system first developed in the 1960s, but remains under constant development to this day. It is made up of three parts: 1. the kernel, 2. the shell, and 3. the programs. This is all about the shell---which interfaces between the kernel (the hub of the operating system) and the user (you!).
