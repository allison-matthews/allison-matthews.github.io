subtitle: Radio Astronomer from Maine. Currently at the University of Virginia.

I am an Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia studying the cosmic evolution of star formation and galaxies. In particular, I use statistical methods to detect and measure the star formation of normal (Milky Way-like) star-forming galaxies through and beyond "cosmic noon." In general, I love thinking about new ways to use deep radio observations to infer general properties (e.g. structure, star formation) about our Universe - if that involves multiwavelength data, all the better!

### what else...

During my free time you can catch me running, hiking the nearby mountains, talking about the great state of Maine, or stuck somewhere with a cat on my lap.
