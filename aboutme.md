I am an Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia studying the cosmic evolution of star formation and galaxies. In particular, I use statistical methods to detect and measure the star formation of normal (Milky Way-like) star-forming galaxies through and beyond "cosmic noon." In general, I love thinking about new ways to use deep radio observations to infer general properties (e.g. structure, star formation) about our Universe - if that involves multiwavelength data, all the better!

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
