### Local Universe
Measures of the evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD) are only as good as the value calculated for today's universe.  The local radio luminosity function calibrates the models and measurements of the evolution of star formation over cosmic time, but more importantly provides a baseline with which to compare the evolution seen at higher redshifts. The current generation of redshift surveys provide distance information for thousands of galaxies over a large angular area of sky - giving better statistics and averaging over as much cosmic variance as possible.
